# Chessboard Detection with OpenCV

This project is part of the final assignment for **CSCI 612 â€“ Applied Computer Vision**, and explores machine vision techniques to detect a chessboard and its pieces using OpenCV in C++.

##  Project Objective

Develop a vision system that can:
- Detect a chessboard under various lighting conditions
- Label grid squares (A1 to H8)
- Detect pieces on the board using computer vision techniques
- Perform in near real-time on embedded hardware

##  Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Library:** OpenCV
- **Hardware:** Logitech C270 webcam, Jetson Nano 2GB (or compatible Linux device)
- **Tools:** Histogram Equalization, CLAHE, Canny Edge Detection, Hough Line Transform, Contour Detection

---

##  Detection Methods

### 1. `cv::findChessboardCorners`
- **Script:** [`chessBoard_detection.cpp`](https://github.com/Ace1032/Computer_Vision_final_project/blob/main/chessBoard_detection.cpp)
- **Outcome:** Works in ideal lighting but fails in low light.

### 2. CLAHE for Low Light Enhancement
- **Script:** [`chessBoard_Low_lighting.cpp`](https://github.com/Ace1032/Computer_Vision_final_project/blob/main/chessBoard_Low_lighting.cpp)
- **Outcome:** Applied adaptive histogram equalization. Slightly improved detection but not reliable.

### 3. Canny + Hough Transform
- **Script:** [`cheassboard_hough_detection.cpp`](https://github.com/Ace1032/Computer_Vision_final_project/blob/main/cheassboard_hough_detection.cpp)
- **Outcome:** Custom pipeline using:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Gaussian blur
  - Canny edge detection
  - Hough line detection

##  Chessboard Labeling

- Intersections of detected lines were analyzed to form an 8x8 matrix.
- Edge lines were trimmed and sorted:
```cpp
std::sort(horizontalRhos.begin(), horizontalRhos.end());
std::sort(verticalRhos.begin(), verticalRhos.end());
